Why Bitdeli?
============

Traditionally a company aspiring to improve their analytics has faced a difficult question: Whether to build or not to build an analytics solution in-house.

The in-house solution requires considerable expertise, time and money upfront. By outsourcing analytics the company surrenders the control of key business metrics and the ability to gain competitive advantage with custom analytics.

Bitdeli solves this dilemma by providing a self-service analytics platform: You can stay fully in control of your analytics without having to become an expert in scalable data infrastructure or the latest paradigm for distributed computing.

Bitdeli is more than just infrastructure for crunching data. One of the biggest benefits of off-the-shelf analytics services, such as Google Analytics, is that they clearly show *what* to do with the data, in addition to making it technically possible. We want to take this approach to the next level.

We at Bitdeli believe in the power of sharing. You can see *what* others have done to answer similar questions as you have and *how* they have done it. All of our `analytics scripts are open-source <http://github.com/bitdeli>`_. You can start using them for your own analytics with a click of a button. Naturally you may to choose to keep your scripts private.

Bitdeli is literally a deli: It is faster and easier than preparing everything from raw ingredients in your own kitchen (and you don't need to be a master chef) while it provides more variety and freedom of choice compared to a full-service restaurant. Plus, most of our scripts are organic.
